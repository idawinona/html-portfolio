<h1>BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO IDA</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<h3>Me before you</h3>
<p>
Though the movie has a sad ending the protaganists played a wonderful role justifying their characters.

<h3>Last Christmas</h3>
<p>
One of the best holiday romcom.

<h3>Miss Congeniality</h3>
<p>
I love anything with Sandra Bullock in it.
